In this updated version, we first check if the user has MetaMask installed and connected to a wallet. If they do, we create a provider and contract object using the skin's contract address and ABI, and get the user's account address. Then, we pass the provider, contract, and account as props to the BuyModal component so that the user can confirm their purchase using their MetaMask wallet. If the user does not have MetaMask installed, we show the MetaMaskModal component instead.
