This contract uses the OpenZeppelin implementation of the ERC721 standard to create an NFT token. The mint function takes a transaction ID as a parameter and mints a new token, assigning it to the sender's address. The transaction ID is stored in a mapping that maps the token ID to the transaction ID. The tokenId variable keeps track of the number of tokens minted so far, and increments each time a new token is minted.
